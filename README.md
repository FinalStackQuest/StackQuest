## Background

StackQuest is a capstone project from the 1702 cohort of Fullstack Academy of Code. We were inspired to dive into a project that required us to learn new technologies, tested and expanded our understanding of development concepts, and that was a lot of fun!

## Install

To install and locally run Stackquest clone or download the project to your machine and run the following commands:

Install all project dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
```
To start the server and watch the server files for updates:
```bash
$ npm run start-dev
```

To have webpack bundle and re-bundle on changes:
```bash
$ npm run build-dev
```
